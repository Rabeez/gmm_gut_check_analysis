# gmm_gut_check_analysis
Some simple analysis for the Gut Check episodes from YouTube show Good Mythical Morning

The inspiration for this was the latest episode (buffalo wings) where the guys disagreed a lot so I thought why not quantify the difference in their taste scales. 

For a quick look you can check out the html file, it has all the plots and my observations. Or [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Rabeez/gmm_gut_check_analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) has the same thing.
